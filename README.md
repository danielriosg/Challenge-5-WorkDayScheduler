<h1>Work Day Scheduler</h1>
This work day scheduler allows users to store their daily events in time blocks. The blocks are color coded, indicating with gray if the time has passed, with red if it is the current time block, and in green if it is a future time block. 
Users can enter an event in each block and save it by clicking the save button on the right of each block. The event will be saved in the local storage, meaning that it will remain even after refreshing the page. 
The project uses Day.js library, Jquery.
